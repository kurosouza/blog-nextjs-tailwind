I am a software engineer from Port Harcourt, Nigeria currently living and working in Europe. I have had a passion for technology and programming from my teenage years. I was mostly inspired by video games and simple electronic gadgets.

I work as a software engineer for large tech company in the Netherlands. When I am not writing code, I like to read scifi books, listen to hip hop music and hang out with my family.
